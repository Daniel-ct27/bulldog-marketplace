Bulldog Marketplace

Bulldog Marketplace is a full-stack web application designed to support a campus-based marketplace where users can post, search, and discover items within a community. The project explores semantic search and modern web technologies to create a more intuitive buying and selling experience.

Project Overview

The goal of Bulldog Marketplace is to move beyond basic keyword search by incorporating semantic search techniques. Instead of matching exact words, the system focuses on understanding user intent and meaning, making it easier to find relevant listings.

This project was built as a collaborative effort and emphasizes both backend intelligence and frontend usability.
